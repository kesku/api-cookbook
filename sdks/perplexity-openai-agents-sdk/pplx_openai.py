This example illustrates how to use a custom provider with a specific agent:
1. We create an asynchronous OpenAI client configured to interact with the Perplexity Sonar API.
2. We define a custom model using this client.
3. We set up an Agent with our custom model and attach function tools.
Note: Tracing is disabled in this example. If you have an OpenAI platform API key,
you can enable tracing by setting the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY or using set_tracing_export_api_key().
